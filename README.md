We can run app from main method or run jar file "revolutRest.jar" with command in cmd "java -jar revolutRest.jar".
In intellij IDE we can create fresh jar: ProjectStructure -> Artifacts -> JAR -> from modules with dependencies -> add main class -> Apply, OK -> Build -> BuildArtifacts -> revolutRest.jar -> build. Find jar in "out" folder.
To run tests we must run app, and then run tests.
Test REST controller we can manually, for example with postman.
